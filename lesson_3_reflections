Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to push your files to github, to keep it on the cloud (like Dropbox).

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you can choose when to be up to date.
